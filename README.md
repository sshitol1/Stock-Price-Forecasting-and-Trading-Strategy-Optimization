Stock Price Forecasting and Trading Strategy Optimization

Overview

This project aims at forecasting stock prices and optimizing trading strategies using advanced machine learning techniques. By analyzing historical stock data, we develop predictive models to forecast future price movements and identify optimal trading strategies.

Features

Data Preparation: Utilization of daily percentage changes in stock prices to enhance data interpretability.
Feature Engineering: Generation of over 97 features, including financial indicators and statistical measures, to feed into the predictive models.
Model Training and Evaluation: Deployment of various machine learning models such as SVM, Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier, Decision Trees, and KNN. Rigorous training and validation on datasets to ensure high accuracy in predictions.
Ensemble Methods: Application of voting, blending, and Adaboosting techniques to improve model performance and accuracy.
Methodology

The project follows a structured approach:

Data Collection and Preprocessing: Historical stock data is collected and preprocessed to calculate daily percentage changes and stratify them into distinct levels.
Feature Engineering: Innovative features are engineered to capture the nuances of the stock market movements.
Model Development: Several predictive models are trained and evaluated. The project explores a variety of algorithms and ensemble methods to enhance prediction accuracy.
Evaluation: Models are evaluated based on their accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The AdaBoosting model, in particular, demonstrated superior performance in our tests.
Results

The project successfully implemented multiple machine learning models, with ensemble methods showing significant improvement in prediction accuracy. The AdaBoosting model emerged as a highly effective tool for forecasting stock prices, offering a promising approach for trading strategy optimization.
